# Ultra Fighters

Ultra Fighters is a shooting game designed for 2 players. The game features interactive objects that can be pushed or destroyed using guns or hands. There are also elevators and doors available to move around the map quickly. To shoot, the player just needs to hold down the shoot button and aim using the direction keys.

The game has settings that allow players to set keybinds, adjust volume, and more. Additionally, there are multiple maps and skins to choose from, as well as the option to customize your nickname.

Unfortunately, the game is not finished and is unlikely to ever be completed due to the break-up of the development team.

GAME created by Tobias, Peter, Matej, and Ado.
